bridgecommand_AppImage how to build

See:
https://github.com/vpelss/bridgecommand_AppImage/blob/main/instructions.txt



Bridgecommand is naval ship simulator.

You can build it yourself here:

[https://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/](https://github.com/bridgecommand/bc)

I have created a Linux AppImage for Bridgecommand for those who can't compile it.

My AppImage version is here: https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage/releases/tag/download

Note: It is easiest to start in a Linux terminal. Making a launchable icon is possible, but will vary depending on your gui. 

- Download
- in a terminal run the following

```
chmod +x Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage
./Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage
```
