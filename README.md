Download a working AppImage for PC (x86_64) or PI 4 (aarch64):

You must make it executable:

chmod +x Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage

or

chmod +x Bridge_Command-aarch64.AppImage

Then run:

./Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage

or

Bridge_Command-aarch64.AppImage

Space Nerds in Space is a linux only space bridge simulator.

You can build it yourself here:

https://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/

I have created a Linux AppImage for Space Nerds In Space for those who can't compile it.

My AppImage version is here: https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage/releases/tag/download

Note: It is easiest to start in a Linux terminal. Making a launchable icon is possible, but will vary depending on your gui. 

- Download
- in a terminal run the following

```
chmod +x Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage
./Bridge_Command-x86_64.AppImage
```
